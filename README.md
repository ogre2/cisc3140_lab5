CISC3140 Lab 5 is a fullstack web application built with Node/Express, SQLite, EJS, and Bootstrap  
that allows users to view and update data about cars. You can view the app here: [https://cisc3140lab5.herokuapp.com/](https://cisc3140lab5.herokuapp.com/).

### **1) Using Git** (Recommended)
Run the following command in your terminal/CLI to clone the API repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/ogre2/cisc3140_lab5.git
```

### **2) Windows**
If you're a Windows OS user, you can install the CISC3140 Lab 4 project using Git by following the instrunctions above.  
You can also install the project using the **[latest release version](https://github.com/ogre2/cisc3140_lab5/releases)** and downloading the zipped source code folder.

### **3) Linux and MacOS**
If you're a Linux or MacOS user, with the aforementioned prerequisites installed and running on your machine. You can employ the Git method  
to install/clone the repo locally on your machine and test the API.

You can also install the project using the **[latest release version](https://github.com/ogre2/cisc3140_lab5/releases)** and downloading the `<tar.gz>` folder.  
Then in your terminal run the following command to unzip and extract
```

```

### **4) Web Browser**
Alternatively, you can view the API on your browser by visiting **[https://cisc3140lab5.herokuapp.com/](https://cisc3140lab5.herokuapp.com/)**.  
Note: The API's HTTP requests are limited to `<GET>` requests only, this is due to the database solution employed in the API being SQLite.  
SQLite is a serverless database solution, and therefor changes to the database done through HTTP requests such as `<POST>` or `<PATCH>` cannot work  
on the web version. It is recommended that you install and run the project **locally** to take advantage of all created endpoints.

## **Launching/Using API**
1. Using your terminal/CLI, navigate to the **cisc3140_lab4-vX.X.X** folder.
2. Using your terminal/CLI, run the `<npm install>` command to automatically download all dependencies for the project.
3. Using your terminal/CLI, run the `<npm start>` command to launch the API server.
   1. Your console will log '**<span style="color:#15a766">server is running on port:4000</span>**', to indicate that the API has launched successfully.
   2. Your console will log '**<span style="color:#3f70b8">Connected to database...</span>**', to indicate that the API has successfully connected to the database.
4. On your browser, navigate to `<localhost:4000>`.
5. You should see `<{"message":"Ok"}>`, which will indicate that the API is working.
6. Visit the various API end points at your leisure.
   1. View the **[API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15181657/UyrHftTK)** for details on endpoints.
